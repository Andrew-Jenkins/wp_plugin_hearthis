# Overview

This is a Wordpress Plugin which allows you to easily integrate a player widget for a track, set, playlist or from [hearthis.at][1] into your Wordpress Blog by using Wordpress Shortcodes.

Requirements
==========

 * [Wordpress][2], version >= 3.1.0  
 * [httpful][3] / [php http client][4]

Description
-----------------

Use it in your blog post or pages by adding this Shortcode to your content:  
      `[hearthis]http://hearthis.at/LINK_TO_TRACK_SET_OR_ARTIST/[/hearthis]`.

The Plugin also supports optional parameters. By now these are width, height and params.
The "params" parameter will pass the given options on to the player widget. The hearthis 
player accepts the following parameter options:

* hcolor = (hex color codes) will show the play button, waveform and selections in this color
* theme  = you can choose between these 2 options __transparent__ (default) or __transparent_black__
