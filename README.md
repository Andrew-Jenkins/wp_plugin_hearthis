# Overview

This is a Wordpress Plugin which allows you to easily integrate a player widget for a track, set, playlist or from hearthis.at[1] into your Wordpress Blog by using Wordpress Shortcodes.

Requirements
==========

Description
-----------------

Use it in your blog post or pages by adding this Shortcode to your content:
`[hearthis]http://hearthis.at/LINK_TO_TRACK_SET_OR_ARTIST/[/hearthis]`.

The Plugin also supports optional parameters. By now these are width, height and params.
The "params" parameter will pass the given options on to the player widget. The hearthis
