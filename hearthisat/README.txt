== Description ==

The hearthis.at plugin allows you to integrate a player widget from hearthis.at into your Wordpress Blog by using a Wordpress shortcodes.
this is how it works:      
`[hearthis]http://http://hearthis.at/LINK_TO_TRACK_SET_OR_ARTIST/[/hearthis]`  

These Shortcodes do also supports several optional parameters. These parameters will pass its given value as option on to the player widget.  
At the moment the hearthis Shortcode accepts the following parameter and options:

*   `width` define the width of the widget (number value and if <= 100 means in %  and abouve 100 is in pixels. default is 100)
*   `height` define the height of the widget (integer value or empty for default )    
if this value is less 100 it will passed as percent if it is higher than 100 it will parsed as pixels
*   `theme` you can choose between these 2 options transparent (default) or transparent_black
*   `hcolor` button and passed time color for the waveform (not set or a hex color with or without a prependig #)
*   `color` highlight color for the waveform (not set or a hex color with or without a prependig #)
*   `style` style '1' is default waveform and value '2' is the digitized waveform
*   `background` shows the background if set (values not set, 1 or 0, if is 1 the height is 170px)
*   `waveform` hides the waveform if you set to '1', change track height fixed to 95px (values 0 off, 1 on)
*   `autoplay` starts with autoplay (values 0 off, 1 on)
*   `cover` hides the cover image if its set (values 0 off, 1 on)
*   `block_size` size of the waveform blocks (numberr, steps from 1 to 10, default is 2, works only if style is set to 2)
*   `block_space` space size between the waveform blocks (integer, steps from 1 to 10, default is 1, works only if style is set to 2)
*   `liststyle` only available on playlists or profile urls, this will display a list as single tracks buut works only if you provide value 'single'. If you enter a profile uri from hearthis.at this listing is limited by 50 tracks.
*   `css` string, should contain a valid uri that will load an additional css file link the link tag


**IMPORTANT NOTE**

This Version **is now stable** and provides also a fallback for some old hearthis Shortcode params.    
So these params could also being used because they will passed to the their new names.

*   `color2` the old name of the hcolor property
*   `params` a params string with the namend values 
*   `digitized_size` old name of the waveform block size (see block_size)
*   `digitized_space` old name of the waveform block space (see block_space)

== Examples ==

Embed a single track without any params.   
    `[hearthis]https://hearthis.at/shawne/shawne-pornbass-12-06042013-2300-0200-uhr/[/hearthis]`

Embed a playlist or setlist without params.   
    `[hearthis]https://hearthis.at/crecs/set/tbase-feat-charlotte-haining-oscar-michael-unspoken-words-ep/[/hearthis]`

Embed a user profile with a blue hightlight color.   
    `[hearthis hcolor="0000ff"]https://hearthis.at/crecs/[/hearthis]`

Embed a user without color params and autostart.   
    `[hearthis hcolor="#ff5c24" color="#33fd11" autostart="1"]http://hearthis.at/djforce/[/hearthis]`

Embeds a track with a black theme and a background image (if set) and hides the cover.   
    `[hearthis theme="transparent" background="1" cover="1"]https://hearthis.at/djforce/baesser-forcesicht-dnbmix/[hearthis]`

Embeds a track player with 50% width and a green button color.   
    `[hearthis width="50" color="#33fd11"]https://hearthis.at/crec/maverick-krl-c-recordings-guestmix/[/hearthis]`

Embeds a track player with 500px width and hides the waveform and has the transparent_black theme. Remember this will change track height to 95 pixels.    
    `[hearthis width="500" waveform="1" params="color2=00ff00&theme=transparent_black"]https://hearthis.at/djforce/dj-force-is-breaking-the-habit-electrobreaks-bass-dubstep-mix-052014/[/hearthis]`
  
Embeds a playlist or set with 400px height.   
    `[hearthis height="400"]https://hearthis.at/set/51-7/[/hearthis]`
  
This is not a real option, its more like a hook and works only with playlists or profile urls.
So if you want to display a playlist or user profile as single tracks and not as a list you can set this option. 
For users we limited this by 50 tracks. Does only take effect if the value single is inside the liststyle tag.    
    `[hearthis liststyle="single"]https://hearthis.at/djforce/set/dubstep-mixes/[/hearthis]`
