The hearthis.at plugin allows you to integrate a player widget from hearthis.at into your Wordpress Blog by using a Wordpress shortcodes.


== Description ==

The hearthis.at plugin allows you to integrate a player widget from hearthis.at into your Wordpress Blog by using a Wordpress shortcodes.
this is how it works:      
`[hearthis]http://http://hearthis.at/LINK_TO_TRACK_SET_OR_ARTIST/[/hearthis]`  

These Shortcodes do also supports several optional parameters. These parameters will pass its given value as option on to the player widget.  
At the moment the hearthis Shortcode accepts the following parameter and options:

*   `width` define the width of the widget (integer value or % value or empty string '', default is 100%)
*   `height` define the height of the widget (integer value or empty for default )    
if this value is less 100 it will passed as percent if it is higher than 100 it will parsed as pixels
*   `theme` you can choose between these 2 options transparent (default) or transparent_black
*   `hcolor` button and passed time color for the waveform (not set or a hex color string with prependig #)
*   `color` highlight color for the waveform (not set or a hex color string with prependig #)
*   `style` style 1 or 2
*   `background` shows the background if set (values not set, 1 or 0, if is 1 the height is 400px)
*   `waveform` hide the waveform if it set to 1 (values not set, 1 or 0)
*   `autoplay` starts with autoplay (values not set, 1 or 0)
*   `cover` hides the cover img if it set to 1 (values not set, 1 or 0)
*   `block_size` size of the waveform blocks (integer, steps from 1 to 10, default is 2, works only if style is set to 2)
*   `block_space` size of the spaces between the waveform blocks (integer, steps from 1 to 10, default is 1, works only if style is set to 2)
*   `liststyle` only available on playlists and will also works only with 'single' as value
*   `css` string, should contain a valid uri that will load an additional css file link the link tag


**IMPORTANT NOTE**

This Version **is now stable** and provides also a fallback for some old hearthis Shortcode params.    
So these params could also being used because they will passed to the their new names.

*   `color2` the old name of the hcolor property
*   `param` a params string with the namend values 
*   `digitized_size` old name of the waveform block size (see block_size)
*   `digitized_space` old name of the waveform block space (see block_space)
